Hi all This is my website. well more like a testsite at the moment.

My gools/plans for this site are 
1) I want to practice codeing\do a bit of game development
2) build a dynamic and intuative learning space for studying and working on maths problems
3) Hopefully make some money maybe?
4) I also want to do some video editing so that may popup here as well
